## 🚀 About Me 
I am a data analyst passionate about helping businesses make sense of their data by turning complex, messy datasets into clear stories and actionable insights. I focus on building practical dashboards that stakeholders actually use, automating repetitive processes to improve efficiency, and developing analytical models that support better planning and decision-making.

I enjoy working across the full data lifecycle—from data cleaning and validation to analysis, visualization, and insight delivery—with a strong emphasis on accuracy and business relevance. I am particularly motivated by solving real-world problems with data and ensuring insights lead to measurable outcomes.

Beyond my day-to-day work, I enjoy mentoring and teaching others who are learning data analysis, helping them build confidence and practical skills. I value the “aha” moments when data uncovers something meaningful and useful, and I aim to consistently deliver insights that drive informed decisions and growth.
